These are a set of example files to use when trying Biodiverse.  
Note that these are fictional data so the results have no meaning beyond example purposes.

Data files that can be imported:
Example_site_data.csv               Species sample data in a Lambert Conformal Conic projection for Australia (see coastline.prj for definition)
Example_site_data_matrix_form.csv	Species data in matrix form (resolution 25000)
Example_matrix.txt                  Matrix data (dissimilarity)
Example_tree.nex                    Tree data
Example_tree_remap.txt              Remap table to change the tree names to match the site data

Data files that have already been imported (easier to start off with):
example_data.bps	Example project file.  The next three files have been extracted from it.
example_data.bds	Example basedata file
example_matrix.bms	Example matrix file
example_tree.bts	Example tree file



Additional data:
coastline.shp and associated files are vector data to overlay when plotting a map.
