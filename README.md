# Biodiverse

Biodiverse is a tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, trait and matrix-based (e.g. genetic distance) relationships, as well as related environmental and temporal variations. Biodiverse supports the following processes: 

  1. Linked visualisation of data distributions in geographic, taxonomic, phylogenetic and matrix spaces;
  1. Spatial moving window analyses including richness, endemism, phylogenetic diversity and beta diversity;
  1. Spatially constrained agglomerative cluster analyses; 
  1. Spatially constrained region grower analyses; 
  1. Interactive visualisation of turnover patterns (for example beta-diversity); and 
  1. Randomisations for hypothesis testing. 

Biodiverse is open-source and supports user developed extensions. It can be used both through a graphical user interface (GUI) and through user written scripts.

More than 300 indices are supported.  See the [Indices](https://purl.org/biodiverse/wiki/Indices) page.
