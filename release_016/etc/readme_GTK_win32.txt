The following files in the Gtk folder were downloaded from an earlier bundled Gtk/Glade release.  No doubt one can get them from a more recent one as well.

bin\libglade-2.0-0.dll
bin\libxml2.dll
bin\iconv.dll
bin\libart_lgpl_2-2.dll

The remainder of the files in this directory were downloaded from http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html

Additionally, etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc was created using the instructions at the end of gtk+-bundle_2.16.6-20091013_win32.README.txt
