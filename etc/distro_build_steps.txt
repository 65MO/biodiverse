#then zip up the blib folder - tar.gz

#then:
dmake clean

#  note:  the build process will include all bundles.
#  To include only one you must delete the others (revert back using svn).
#  To build the NoGUI version you need to rename its makefile to Makefile.PM.

#  finally, edit the ppd file to refer to the tar.gz file in the codebase href field

#  for a basic cpan distro:

perl Makefile.PL
dmake manifest
dmake tardist

#  the last line won't work on Windows unless tar is installed, but one can always use cygwin
