#  for a basic cpan distro:

perl Makefile.PL
dmake
dmake manifest
dmake dist

#  the last line won't work on Windows unless tar is installed, but one can always use cygwin
# substitute make for dmake

######
#  some other stuff

perl Makefile.PL
dmake test
dmake
dmake ppd

#then zip up the blib folder - tar.gz

#then:
dmake clean

#  note:  the build process will include all files under this folder.

#  finally, edit the ppd file to refer to the tar.gz file in the codebase href field
