These are a set of example files to use when trying Biodiverse.  
Note that these are fictional data so the results have no meaning beyond example purposes.

Data files that can be imported:

Example_site_data.csv               Species sample data in a Lambert Conformal Conic projection for Australia (see coastline.prj for definition)
Example_site_data_matrix_form.csv	Species data in matrix form (resolution 25000)
Example_matrix.txt                  Matrix data (dissimilarity)
Example_tree.nex                    Tree data
Example_tree_remap.txt              Remap table to change the tree names to match the site data

Data files that have already been imported (easier to start off with):
(Note that there are 32 and 64 bit variants due to the random number generator library being used).

example_data_x32.bps	Example project file for use on 32 bit systems.
example_data_x32.bds	Example basedata file.  This is the first basedata object from the 32 bit project file.  
example_data_x32.bps	Example project file for use on 64 bit systems.
example_data_x32.bds	Example basedata file.  This is the first basedata object from the 64 bit project file.  
example_matrix.bms	Example matrix file
example_tree.bts	Example tree file


Additional data:
coastline.shp and associated files are vector data to overlay when plotting a map.
